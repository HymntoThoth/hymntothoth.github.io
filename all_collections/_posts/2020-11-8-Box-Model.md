<div class="boxA">
  <p>
  I broke free on a Saturday morning
  I put the pedal to the floor
  Headed north on Mills Avenue
  And listened to the engine roar
  </p>

  <p>
  My broken house behind me and good things ahead
  A girl named Cathy wants a little of my time
  Six cylinders underneath the hood crashing and kicking
  Ahh, listen to the engine whine
  </p>

<div class="boxB">
  <p>
    I am going to make it through this year
    If it kills me
    I am going to make it through this year
    If it kills me
  </p>
</div>

<div class="boxC">
<p>
  I down-shifted as I pulled into the driveway
The motor screaming out, stuck in second gear
The scene ends badly, as you might imagine
In a cavalcade of anger and fear
There will be feasting and dancing in Jerusalem next year
</p>

<p>
  I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me
I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me
</p>
