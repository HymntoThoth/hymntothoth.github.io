I majored in English Literature at UNC Asheville with a concentration in creative writing. Occasionally I make use of it. Currently, I am enrolled in the Library and Information Science program at UNCG, looking for work within my field and making ends meet in the gig-economy. I read and listen when I have time, and I try to pay attention to the world.
